# Extraction of learning patterns of students in MOOCs

## Abstract

How do students learn in MOOCs? Is there efficient and inefficient learning patterns? This project will aim at giving answers to these question by analysing the activities of hundreds of thousends of students on EPFL Scala MOOC on Cousera. 

## Data description

The data is divided in 56 csv files corresponding to 7 different datasets for 8 sessions of EPFL Scala MOOC. Each session has about 50 thousends of students and several millions of events. 

The sessions names are:
- progfun-002,
- progfun-003,
- progfun-004,
- progfun-005,
- progfun-2012-001,
- progfun1,
- progfun2,
- progfun2-002

For each session the available datasets are:
- `User_Grades`: a table containing one line per student of the session and there final average grade.
- `User_Hash_Mapping`: mapping between the fields `UserSessionID` and `UserAccountID`, which differentiates between the students ID for the session of the MOOC and the general Coursera user ID.
- `Forum_Info`: Meta data about the forum
- `Video_Info`: Meta data about the lecture videos
- `Problem_Events_With_Info`: Time series of events concerning the assignments
- `Video_Events`: Time series of events concerning the videos
- `Forum_Events`: Time series of events concerning the forum

## Challenging aspects 

### Visualizations


### Big data 


## Expected results 
- Simple and clear visualization of students 
- Extensive analysis of the learning patterns and measure of correlations between pattern used and grade improvment in assignments
-
